# Windsurf AI Assistant Documentation

This directory contains documentation generated by the Windsurf AI assistant during development work.

## Purpose

This is where the AI assistant stores:
- Planning documents
- Progress tracking
- Work summaries
- Implementation notes
- Refactoring plans and completions
- Cleanup reports

**Note:** This is separate from the main project documentation to keep AI-generated work artifacts organized.
